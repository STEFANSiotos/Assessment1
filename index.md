My education is a year 12 VCE at Bellarine secondary college and some units from 1st year engineering and 1st year commerce from Deakin uni. I have a dog named Denver who is a german short hair pointer. </p>

<p> His favourite hobby is chasing frisbees which is perfect for me as I play disc golf casually on weekends so when I am practicing, I donâ€™t have to go and pick up my disc because Denver brings them back to me. </p>
<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p> My interest in IT started in 2004 when I first playing RuneScape, I played for many years on and off. Although a video game is what first peaked my interest in computers and IT it has continued to grow, recently the inspiration of my interest in IT has been from the lex fridman podcast https://www.youtube.com/user/lexfridman I am interested in all areas of IT but lately been more focussed on Machine Learning and AI. </p>

<p> My father is a first generation immigrant whose parents came from Greece and Australia, and my mother is Australian I have a pretty standard Australian culture at home with both parents only speaking English.<br> My education is a year 12 VCE at Bellarine secondary college and some units from 1st year engineering and 1st year commerce from Deakin uni. I have a dog named Denver who is a german short hair pointer. </p>

<p> His favourite hobby is chasing frisbees which is perfect for me as I play disc golf casually on weekends so when I am practicing, I don’t have to go and pick up my disc because Denver brings them back to me. </p>
<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p> My interest in IT started in 2004 when I first playing RuneScape, I played for many years on and off. Although a video game is what first peaked my interest in computers and IT it has continued to grow,<br> recently the inspiration of my interest in IT has been from the lex fridman podcast https://www.youtube.com/user/lexfridman I am interested in all areas of IT but lately been more focussed on Machine Learning and AI. </p>
<h2> Ideal Job </h2>

<p>The job involves working alongside scientists and using machine learning technology to develop applications and systems to support the scientists. This job is appealing to me because not only do you get to work with the future of information technology you will also be working alongside people who are focussing on the future of other disciplines.

Qualifications needed a Tertiary degree in either science, engineering, computer science, information technology or a relevant field. As well as experience using various machine learning applications Computer vision, Natural language or a tradition tabular data-based ML algorithms.
And also requires a high level of knowledge and experience in or of the programming languages mainly used by the csiro which are Python, R, JavaScript, MATLAB, Fortran, C, and C++.
The skills I currently possess are being willing to Learn, being a team player, working autonomously, customer service skills, knowledge of tools, building computers. My qualifications are Year 12 VCE. My previous work experience is 4 years at IGA, 2 weeks at a Farming Manufacturing company, 3 Years at a law firm as a receptionist and 1 week as an Engineering technician trainee at Barwon Health.

I plan on obtaining the skills and qualifications for the job by completing a bachelors in information technology as well as studying on the side various programming languages</p>

<p> The results of these tests don’t mean very much to me I feel as though I would of already characterized myself as a tactile learner and an explorer. <br>It is interesting to see that the tests resembled what I believed to be true already.
These results may affect the way I work in a team by making me rethink some of my decisions and pause for a moment before I do something <br> and ask myself am I just acting like a typical ISTP-T and how may other people react to my characteristics.
I wouldn’t take this into account as I believe the results, <br> I received from my personality test will let me slip into any team and function well as I am fairly balanced on how I interact with others. Perhaps I may ask what other people received just to understand how they may work in a group so I can prepare. </p>

<h2> PROJECT </h2>
<h3> Skin cancer photo app </h3>
<p>My Project is an app that lets you take a photo of a mole or freckle using your smart phone camera and then uses a machine learning algorithm to say what % chance the spot has of being cancerous and then adds the data to the machine learning program. It would use data from people continuously checking to see if they have cancerous moles as well as working with hospitals to have a data source to start with. </p>
<br>
<p>The motivation behind this is having worried about spots I have seen on my own skin and wishing that I could figure it out straight away instead of trying to self-diagnose through google and then having to go to a gp only to be told that no its not cancer. Another motivation is that two in three Australians will be diagnosed with skin cancer by the age of 70 and around 1800 australians will die each year (https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/cancer/skin-cancer-in-australia/summary) . It wouldn’t surprise me if those numbers increase into the future as a result of global warming as well.</p>
<br>
<p>The app Will have a sleek UI and look and function similar to a normal camera app so that people of all generations will be able to use it. It will be as simple as taking a picture of a mark or spot and then depending on the accuracy may ask for multiple photos from different angles and then it will display the result on the screen, and link you to your nearest gp. Ideally the app would be recommended by health professionals and then it can partner with specific skin cancer organizations in your area. As the app began to get used it would improve its rate of predicting skin cancer as it will continuously gather more and more data. The app would always err on the side of caution as a false positive in most cases is better than a false negative. The app would be available on android and IOS. It will use computer visions and machine learning to perform accurate cancer checks and would be more reliable than a human examining the mole / mark. Other features it will provide will be Mole and mark tracking to see if any of them have changed and Tips and tricks to preventing skin cancer.</p>
<br>
<p>The app will use JavaScript as the front end and Python as the backend. It will need to use Computer vision models as well as having a large source of data to begin with so it can make accurate predictions from the start and only improve over time. It will need large servers to store the information as it won’t be able to run directly from your phone and will need a connection to the internet.</p>
<br>
<p>The skills required will be a large amount of experience with python and JavaScript as well as a background in machine learning and computer science. The skills will be hard to develop but shouldn’t be to hard to find as you wouldn’t need a permanent employ and could use various consultants. Sourcing the starting data may be the hardest part and would require some time and conversations with medical companies.</p>
<br>
<p>If this project is successful then the original problem would be partly solved as it would provide reassurance and save skin cancer experts a lot of time. Ideally it would also reduce the amount of deaths each year caused by skin cancer as it will increase early detection. It may increase the amount of skin cancer that is found each year but that is a bonus as it means that more people are finding it earlier.</p>

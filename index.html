<p> His favourite hobby is chasing frisbees which is perfect for me as I play disc golf casually on weekends so when I am practicing, I don’t have to go and pick up my disc because Denver brings them back to me. </p>
<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p> My interest in IT started in 2004 when I first playing RuneScape, I played for many years on and off. Although a video game is what first peaked my interest in computers and IT it has continued to grow,<br> recently the inspiration of my interest in IT has been from the lex fridman podcast https://www.youtube.com/user/lexfridman I am interested in all areas of IT but lately been more focussed on Machine Learning and AI. </p>

<p>The job involves working alongside scientists and using machine learning technology to develop applications and systems to support the scientists. This job is appealing to me because not only do you get to work with the future of information technology you will also be working alongside people who are focussing on the future of other disciplines.

Qualifications needed a Tertiary degree in either science, engineering, computer science, information technology or a relevant field. As well as experience using various machine learning applications Computer vision, Natural language or a tradition tabular data-based ML algorithms.
And also requires a high level of knowledge and experience in or of the programming languages mainly used by the csiro which are Python, R, JavaScript, MATLAB, Fortran, C, and C++.
The skills I currently possess are being willing to Learn, being a team player, working autonomously, customer service skills, knowledge of tools, building computers. My qualifications are Year 12 VCE. My previous work experience is 4 years at IGA, 2 weeks at a Farming Manufacturing company, 3 Years at a law firm as a receptionist and 1 week as an Engineering technician trainee at Barwon Health.

I plan on obtaining the skills and qualifications for the job by completing a bachelors in information technology as well as studying on the side various programming languages</p>

<p> The results of these tests don’t mean very much to me I feel as though I would of already characterized myself as a tactile learner and an explorer. <br>It is interesting to see that the tests resembled what I believed to be true already.
These results may affect the way I work in a team by making me rethink some of my decisions and pause for a moment before I do something <br> and ask myself am I just acting like a typical ISTP-T and how may other people react to my characteristics.
I wouldn’t take this into account as I believe the results, <br> I received from my personality test will let me slip into any team and function well as I am fairly balanced on how I interact with others. Perhaps I may ask what other people received just to understand how they may work in a group so I can prepare. </p>
